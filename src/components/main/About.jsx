                        For an acoustic guitar, light woods "ash, linden" are
                        ideal, which will give the instrument a rich timbre
                        in the midrange, and also have an excellent balance
                        between the lower and upper registers. For electric
                        guitars, medium-weight woods are usually used,
                        such as maple, mahogany, etc. For an acoustic guitar,
